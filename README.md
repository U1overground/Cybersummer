# Deep Learning–Based Anomaly Detection for Cyberattacks on Traffic Signals

This project demonstrates a machine-learning approach to detect cyberattacks on urban traffic signals using only traffic flow data. We simulate realistic attack scenarios in a virtualized network and show that:

- **Longest Stop Duration** and **Total Jam Distance** are strong indicators of compromised signals.  
- **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques clarify model decisions, illuminating why certain misclassifications occur.  
- **Stealth Attacks** and **Transitional Data** inconsistencies represent critical challenges, especially in low-traffic or recovery-phase conditions.

By combining simulated attacks and deep learning models, our approach enhances both the **security** and **trustworthiness** of smart transportation systems. It offers:

1. **Attack Simulation** – Targeted disruptions in a semi-realistic traffic environment.  
2. **Deep Learning Detection** – Accurate anomaly detection using traffic-flow metrics.  
3. **Interpretability** – XAI methods to diagnose errors and highlight essential decision factors.
